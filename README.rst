Password Strength
=================

Good (72 bits of Entropy)
-------------------------

===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============
Attack Method                                Guesses per second    Years to Solve  Years to Crack
===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============
Distributed.net guesses per second (RC5-72)  1,105,696,629,234.00             135              67
ElcomSoft guesses per second (NTLM)              2,800,000,000.00          53,480          26,740
Rate limited to 9 guesses per 3 minutes                      0.05  *over 1 quadrillion*
===========================================  ====================  ==============================

Good passwords should be able to withstand unrestricted brute force attempts by national governments and bot nets.

Moderate (63 bits of Entropy)
-----------------------------

===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============
Attack Method                                Guesses per second    Years to Solve  Years to Crack
===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============
Distributed.net guesses per second (RC5-72)  1,105,696,629,234.00            0.26            0.13
ElcomSoft guesses per second (NTLM)              2,800,000,000.00          104.45           52.22
Rate limited to 9 guesses per 3 minutes                      0.05  *over 2 trillion*
===========================================  ====================  ==============================

Moderate passwords should be able to withstand unrestricted brute force attempts by local governments and persistent hackers.

Weak (28 bits of Entropy)
-------------------------

===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============
Attack Method                                Guesses per second    Years to Solve  Years to Crack
===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============
Distributed.net guesses per second (RC5-72)  1,105,696,629,234.00  *less than a second*
-------------------------------------------  --------------------  ------------------------------
ElcomSoft guesses per second (NTLM)              2,800,000,000.00  *less than a second*
-------------------------------------------  --------------------  ------------------------------
Rate limited to 9 guesses per 3 minutes                      0.05             170              85
===========================================  ====================  ==============  ==============

Weak passwords are only viable if they are **never** used on multiple systems and the system they are used on has a mechanism for rate limiting guesses.

Unfortunately, systems that rate limit guesses (ex. lockout thresholds) are still rare. Additionally, even systems with lockout thresholds are often compromised, making the passwords hashes available.

Systems that default to having **no** lockout threshold:

- Windows Server 2008 R2 and previous `Account Policies <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd349793%28WS.10%29.aspx>`_
